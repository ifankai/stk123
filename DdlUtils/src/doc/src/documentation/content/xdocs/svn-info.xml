      <title>Necessary software</title>
      <p>
        DdlUtils uses <a href="ext:tigris/svn">SVN</a> for its source repository. To access it
        you need a SVN client. Unix and Linux systems usually have the <code>svn</code>
        tool built in. For Windows you'll need an additional tool like
        <a href="ext:tigris/tortoisesvn">TortoiseSVN</a>. Also, most modern IDEs have SVN support
        built in or there are plugins that provide this ability.
      </p>

      <title>Unix-based and Linux systems</title>
      <p>
        The <code>svn</code> command is usually readily available in these systems. Here all
        you need to do is to change to a directory where you want to put DdlUtils into, and
        then issue this command:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/ddlutils/trunk ddlutils
      ]]></source>
      <p>
        This will checkout the current development version of DdlUtils in read-only mode.
        This means you can play around with the source without fear for breaking anything
        as the changes cannot be checked back in. 
      </p>
      <note>
        If you're a committer, you'll have to replace the <code>http</code> with
        <code>https</code>.

      <title>Windows systems</title>
      <p>
        For Windows systems, one of the available SVN clients is
        <a href="ext:tigris/tortoisesvn">TortoiseSVN</a> which is an Explorer extension.
        After you've installed it and rebooted you computer (which is necessary
        because of it nature as an Explorer extension), you'll have additional
        options in the context menu in Explorer. Change to a directory where you
        want to checkout DdlUtils, and choose the "SVN Checkout ..." option
        from the context menu. You'll get this dialog:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/tortoisesvn-checkout-dlg.png" alt="TortoiseSVN checkout dialog"/>
      </p>
      <p>
        After you clicked OK, TortoiseSVN will checkout to the designated place. Once it
        has finished you can start using DdlUtils:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/tortoisesvn-checkout-finished.png" alt="TortoiseSVN checkout finished"/>

      <p>
        For Java IDEs, you usually have to install a plugin in order to get SVN support.
